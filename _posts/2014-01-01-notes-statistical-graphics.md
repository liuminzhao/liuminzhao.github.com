# Display data well

- accurate and clear
- show as much information as possible
- avoid unnecessary frills
- things to be compared should be adjacent
- add color for comparison
- value $\propto$ radius
- align things vertically
- use common axes
- use labels not legend
- don't sort alphabetically (use meaningful variables)
- consider taking logs and/or differences
