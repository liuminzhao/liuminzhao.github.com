# 替换 #

- a considerable number of = better
- an adequate amount of  = enough
- an example of this is the fact that = for example
- as a consequence of = because
- at no time = never
- by means of = by
- considerable amount of = much
- despite the fact that = although
- due to the fact that = due to
- during the time that = while, when
- first of all = first
- for the purpose of = to
- has the capability of = can, is able 
- in light of the fact that = because
- in many cases = often 
- in order to = to
- in some cases = sometimes
- in the absence of = without
- in the event that = if
- in view of the fact that = because, since
- it is of interest to note that = note that
- it is often the case that = often 
- majority of = most
- no later than = by
- a number of = many
- on the basis of = by
- prior to = before
- referred to as = called
- regardless of the fact that = even though
- so as to  = to
- utilization = use
- with reference / regard to = about 
- with respect to = about


# Word Choice #

1. use precise word:

	- bad:
	  - several
	  - frequently
	  - with
	- good:
	  - 12h
	  - every 12h
	  - using
	  
2. use simple words

dryness : dry

3. misuse:

`since`: temporal. `because`: causality

4. redundancy and jargon

5. `lab` -> `labortory`

6. avoid abbre

# location #

1. stress : end > begin

2. place old familiar short info at the beginning (topic), and place
new, complex, long info in the end (stress)

3. get to subject quickly, make it short and specific

4. avoid interruption (no which)

# Grammar #

1. first person
2. active voice
3. past tense for observations, completed actives
4. present for generalizations and statements of general validity
5. short sentence
6. active verbs
7. avoid noun clusters
8. use clear pronouns
9. clear comparisons

# ESL #

1. proposition
