Inspiration
===========

This project is inspired by this [reddit
post](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lje2s4/total_distance_traveled_by_gm_magnus_carlsens/).
In that reddit post, the op analyzed and made a plot about total
distance traveled by GM Magnus Carlsen’s Chess pieces over his career.
It was a very interesting post and was done in Python in Google Colab
utilizing chess-python and pandas libraries. Visualization generated
with Seaborn library. I would like to replicate the idea practicing with
R and explored something different.

Read Data
=========

The data can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html" class="uri">http://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html</a>

Once downloaded, thanks for the R package **bigchess**, we can easilly
read the moves and games from **pgn** file to dataframe.

    df  = read.pgn("Carlsen.pgn")

    ## 2021-02-21 20:32:20, successfully imported 3430 games

    ## 2021-02-21 20:32:20, N moves computed

    ## 2021-02-21 20:32:20, extract moves done

    ## 2021-02-21 20:32:22, stat moves computed

    # glimpse(df)

Data Manipualtion
=================

Let’s filter the data by GM **Magnus Carlsen**, and record his moves
overall by *Bishop*, *King*, *Knight*, *Queen*, and *Rook*.

    ## white
    white = df %>% 
      filter(str_detect(White, "Carlsen,M")) %>% 
      mutate(name = White, 
             player = "white", 
             isWhite = TRUE, 
             MC_result = case_when(
               Result == '1-0' ~ 'W',
               Result == '0-1' ~ 'L',
               Result == '1/2-1/2' ~ 'D'
             ), 
             B_moves = W_B_moves, 
             K_moves = W_K_moves,
             N_moves = W_N_moves,
             O_moves = W_O_moves,
             Q_moves = W_Q_moves,
             R_moves = W_R_moves, 
             P_moves = NMoves - W_B_moves - W_K_moves - W_N_moves - W_Q_moves-W_R_moves - W_O_moves) %>% 
      mutate(MC_result = factor(MC_result, levels=c("W", "D", "L"))) %>% 
      select(name, player, MC_result, NMoves, B_moves, K_moves, N_moves, Q_moves, R_moves, P_moves, O_moves)

    black = df %>% 
      filter(str_detect(Black, "Carlsen,M")) %>% 
      mutate(name = Black, 
             player = "Black", 
             isWhite = FALSE, 
             MC_result = case_when(
               Result == '1-0' ~ 'L',
               Result == '0-1' ~ 'W',
               Result == '1/2-1/2' ~ 'D'
             ), 
             B_moves = B_B_moves, 
             K_moves = B_K_moves,
             N_moves = B_N_moves,
             O_moves = B_O_moves,
             Q_moves = B_Q_moves,
             R_moves = B_R_moves, 
             P_moves = NMoves - B_B_moves - B_K_moves - B_N_moves - B_Q_moves-B_R_moves - B_O_moves) %>% 
      mutate(MC_result = factor(MC_result, levels=c("W", "D", "L"))) %>% 
      select(name, player, MC_result, NMoves, B_moves, K_moves, N_moves, Q_moves, R_moves, P_moves, O_moves)


    # both = df %>% 
    #  filter(str_detect(Black, "Carlsen") & str_detect(White, "Carlsen"))
    # it happens that there is one day with both players named Carlsen

    # by games:
    games = bind_rows(white, black)

    # by pieces
    carlsen = bind_rows(white, black) %>% 
      gather(key="type", value="moves", -c(name, player, MC_result, NMoves)) %>% 
      mutate(move_pct = moves/NMoves, 
             piece = case_when(
               type == 'B_moves' ~ 'Bishop',
               type == 'K_moves' ~ 'King',
               type == 'N_moves' ~ 'Knight',
               type == 'Q_moves' ~ 'Queen',
               type == 'R_moves' ~ 'Rook',
               type == 'P_moves' ~ 'Pawn'
               ), 
             piece = factor(piece, levels = c('King', 'Queen', 'Rook', 'Bishop', 'Knight', 'Pawn'))
             )

Get summary
-----------

Let’s summarize how the distribution of moves by piece type per game

    carlsen %>% 
      filter(type != "O_moves") %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x=piece, y=move_pct, color = player)) + 
      geom_boxplot() + 
      coord_flip()+
      xlab("Chess Piece") + 
      ylab("Move Percentage within Game") +
      scale_color_grey()+
      ggtitle("Move Percentage by Chess Pieces of GM Magnus Carlsen") + 
      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
      theme(legend.title=element_blank()
            )

Plots
=====

Winning percentage by Opening Hand
----------------------------------

The R package **bigchess** has some interesting functions, such as
**browse\_opening** which can explore the winning percentage by opening
moves:

    bo = browse_opening(subset(df, grepl("Carlsen", White)))

Winning distribution
--------------------

    winpct = games %>% 
      count(player, MC_result) %>% 
      group_by(player) %>% 
      mutate(freq = n/sum(n))

    winpct %>% 
      ggplot(aes(fill=MC_result, y=freq, x=player))+
      geom_bar(position="stack", stat="identity") + 
      coord_flip()+
      xlab("Player") + 
      ylab("Winning Percentage") +
      scale_fill_manual(values = c("green", "grey", "red"))+
      ggtitle("Winning Percentage by Black/White of GM Magnus Carlsen") + 
      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
      theme(legend.title=element_blank()
            )
