SQL vs DATA step

# subset

## columns

	select col1, col2
	from

## rows

	select *
	from **
	where (condition)

## use calculated variable

	where calculated newvar > 14;

## based on summary stats

	SELECT * FROM ex.admits
	WHERE (bp_sys GE
		(SELECT MEAN(bp_sys)+ 2*STD(bp_sys))
			FROM ex.admits))
				OR (bp_sys LE
	(SELECT (MEAN(bp_sys) - 2*STD(bp_sys))
	FROM ex.admits));

subquery

# Join

## Inner

rows matched in both tables

	from dat1 as a, dat2 as b
	where a.id = b.id

or

	from dat1 a INNER JOIN dat2 b
	on id1 = id2

### Three table

	from a, b, c
	where (id1 = id2) AND (hosp = hosp_id)

## Left

keep the rows not matched in left


# Summary

	COUNT = N
	MIN
	MAX

# operator

	where primdx LIKE '410%'
	IN
