A note for Machine Learning
===============

Reference: Kevin Murphy, Machine Learning A Probability Perspective

<http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/pml-intro-22may12.pdf>

- predictive / supervised learning: map x -> y
  - training set D
  - if y categorical : classification, pattern recognition
  - if y real number: regression

- descriptive (unsupervised learning)
  - only have D
  - to find interesting patterns (knowledge discovery)
  - discover clusters
  - latent factors (PCA)
  - matrix completion
- Concepts
  - parametric model vs non-parametric model
  - k nearest neighbor
  - curse of dimensionality
