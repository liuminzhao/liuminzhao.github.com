Get BibTeX from Google Scholar
==========

1. go to www.google.com/scholar.

2. scholar preference

3. Bibliography Manager: choose BibTeX

4. search for paper and click 'import into BibTeX'

5. copy that in your bib file.

But the problem is that there's still some error in the bibtex from google scholar, for example.

<http://scholar.google.com/scholar.bib?q=info:Kb5Zq_JwPi0J:scholar.google.com/&output=citation&hl=en&as_sdt=40000&ct=citation&cd=2>

    @article{alan2002categorical,  title={{Categorical data analysis}},  author={Alan, A.},  journal={Editorial John Willey \& Sons},  year={2002}}
	
actually, the author is Dr. Alan Agresti, and the publisher is John Wiley & Sons. Well, anyone has better suggestions?
