JIT Compilation in R
====================

**Just-in-time**

- <http://www.r-statistics.com/2012/04/speed-up-your-r-code-using-a-just-in-time-jit-compiler/>
- <http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/compiler/html/compile.html>

In `~/.Renviron`:

	R_COMPILE_PKGS=TRUE
	R_ENABLE_JIT=3

> JIT is disabled if the argument is 0. If enable is 1 then closures are compiled before their first use. If enable is 2, then in addition closures are also compiled before they are duplicated (useful for some packages, like lattice, that store closures in lists). If enable is 3 then in addition all loops are compiled before they are executed.

# Usage #

at the beginning of the code

	require(compiler)
	enableJIT(3)

	fc = cmpfun(f)
	system.time(fc)
