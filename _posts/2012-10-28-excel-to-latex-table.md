Calc2LaTeX Plug-in for Making LaTeX Tables
==========

It’s really disgusting to make complicated tables when you are typing $$\LaTeX$$, here’s one method helping you to get $$\LaTeX$$ code for whatever table you want. 

The basic idea is to take advantage of those WYSIWYG software like Excel or OpenOffice Spreadsheet. There’s a plug-in called [Excel2Latex](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/Excel2Latex.shtml)  which could transform your excel table into $$\LaTeX$$ code. While for free OpenOffice Spreadsheet, the [calc2latex](http://calc2latex.sourceforge.net/) plug-in is quite helpful. By that, you will no longer worry about how to make multicolumn, multirow, all kinds of weird tables in $$\LaTeX$$.
